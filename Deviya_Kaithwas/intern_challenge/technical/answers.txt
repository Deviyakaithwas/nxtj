1.  Explain, in your own words, the importance of data consistency in real-time applications.
->Data consistency is a crucial aspect that ensures the accuracy and reliability of data. So if data is inconsistent, there is nothing right

Data consistency is the accuracy, completeness, and correctness of data stored in a database. The same data across all related systems, applications, and databases is when we say that data is consistent. Inconsistent data can lead to incorrect analysis, decision-making, and outcome

2. How do you handle concurrency issues in a multi-user environment?
->To handle concurrency problems, use the following DataBlade API memory-locking functions in UDRs that update named memory. Request a lock on the specified named-memory block and wait for the lock to be obtained.

3. Describe a scenario where you had to optimize database queries for better performance.
->
explores different ways and tips to make SQL queries perform better.
Indexing. One key technique for speeding up queries is indexing. ...
Use EXISTS Instead of IN. ...
Use Appropriate Datatype. ..

4. Discuss the trade-offs between using WebSockets and HTTP/2 for real-time communication.
->ðŸ’´ Generally speaking, WebSockets should be used if bidirectional and full-duplex communication, low latency, and high throughput are desired. On the other hand, HTTP/2 is advantageous for compatibility, security, efficiency, or flexibility for general web browsing or RESTful APIs.
